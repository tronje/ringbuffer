# ringbuffer
A very simple circular or ring buffer, written as an exercise.
Feel free to use it in any way you please, but keep in mind that it was never intended for any serious use.

For more information on ring buffers, look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer

Documentation may be added in the future, if I can be bothered.
If you actually want to use this, have a look at ringbuffer.h, which should be concise enough.
